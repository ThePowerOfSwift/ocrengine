-------

Download the Tesseract engine (3.03). Source available at (Note am using Release Candidate version here)

Download and install Leptonica 1.71 which is image processing and conversion tool used by Tesseract,

In case if your Ubuntu machine doesn't have necessary tools to run autogen and make commands, Install it using the commands below,

sudo apt-get install automake
sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool

Once you are done with this extract Leptonica and tesseract package using command,

tar -zxvf 3.03-rc1.tar.gz
tar -zxvf leptonica-1.71.tar.gz

Change the directory to leptonica and install it from the source using the commands,

sudo ./autogen.sh
mkdir ~/local
sudo ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/
sudo make
sudo make install

Change the directory to tesseract-ocr-3.03-rc1 and execute the same set of commands given above.

Verify the installation using the command tesseract -v and it should give you the installed tesseract version number.

Copy the libtesseract.so, libtesseract.so.3, libtesseract.so.3.0.3 libraries to /usr/lib/. These shared objects are used by the Java Implementation while linking to native libraries. And yah these files will be available in the path,
